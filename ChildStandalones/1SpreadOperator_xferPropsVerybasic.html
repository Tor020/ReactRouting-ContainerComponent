s this the best way to transfer properties?
Using the spread operator to transfer properties is convenient, and it is a marked improvement over explicitly defining each property at each component like we were doing originally. The thing is, even the spread operator approach isn't a perfect solution. If all you want to do is transfer a property to a particular component, having each intermediate component play a role in passing it on is unnecessary. Worse, it has the potential to be a performance bottleneck. Any change to a property that you are passing along will trigger a component update on each component along the property's path. That's not a good thing! We will look at better ways later on that solve this "transferring properties" problem much better without any side effects.



```
 explain what are constructor(props, context) and super(props, context) and explain their purpose

 ```

 ```

 They are just part of the ES6 classes implementation: https://www.kirupa.com/javascript/classy_way_to_create_objects.htm
 
The purpose of the constructor is to automatically execute any code as part of creating the object.

Every React component gets a few arguments passed in during creation. 

The props argument contains the things you receive via this.props.

The context argument is something you’ll rarely need to use…except when using Redux and related libraries that help manage state.
