  render() {
    console.log(this.props) //this will output the props, which are added into the jsx where the attributes would've been added in html
    //  ex: html : jsx
    //  <h1 class ='example'></h1>  <Heading className ='example'/>

//Notice when we use the component, we're passing in a name attribute. This attribute can then be accessed inside the component as this.props.name.



//Breakdown of 
this.props.PROPNAME

//This refers to the component. ie: this component
//props is an object available
//propname is the label that is accessible from the object

// together -> this.props.PROPNAME -> references the object located inside this component that PROPNAME references

// You can use this.props.PROPNAME anywhere inside of the render method to reference the prop


// React DevTools

// using $r after selecting a component in the React dev tools will let you use that as a reference in the console. It can be substituted for this.props.PROPNAME = $r.props.PROPNAME
//$0 is the chrome basic equivalent for any JS
